# Bash exercises
These are the exercises from exercism.io that I worked on

I am studying and working on the exercises from a web site called Exercism.io. This repository is a collection of exercises I worked on from the bash track.

Bash track: https://exercism.io/tracks/bash

### Testing the scripts
The web site gives a test script for each problem. To run the script you have to install Bats. More about Bats at: https://github.com/sstephenson/bats .

After installing Bats, just run ``` bats name_of_the_script.sh ```. Obs: you may need to comment or erase the ```skip``` command from the test script.
